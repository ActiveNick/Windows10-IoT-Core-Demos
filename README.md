# Windows10-IoT-Core-Demos
Various demos for learning maker &amp; IoT projects on [Windows 10 IoT Core](http://dev.windows.com/iot) using UWP &amp; C#, Arduino, etc. The demos include a variety of original demos as well as official Microsoft & third-party samples I use frequently in conference & meetup talks.

## SAMPLES
- **Blinkly (C#)**: Blink an LED, aka Hello World "Maker Edition"
- **PushButton (C#)**: Basic push button sample to light an LED
- **GHI (C#)**: Sample app to test the capabilities of various Hats & Shields from GHI Electronics, including Gadgeteer
- **GHI (C#) Light & Temp**: Measure ambient light & temperature using the GHI Electronics FezHat

## The Maker Show Episode 5 - Installing Windows 10 on a Raspberry Pi 2
In [this episode of The Maker Show](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/themakershow/5), Kenny Spade gets Windows 10 up and running on a Raspberry Pi 2, and takes a look at what it comes with out of the box. He examines setup with a display for the Pi, how you can get the system up and running in a headless mode through the Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard and the Windows Device Portal, and takes a look at the options that gives you. Finally, he connects through a remote PowerShell session to see what opportunities open up.
